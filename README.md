# Side note
The Orbit Proxy is part of another official website made by me, which is a website that allows you to bypass blocked games and websites on school computers. Check it out by clicking on the 'Back to Orbit' link on the proxy. 


# How to use
Simply type in your URL for any website that you would like to visit in the field. Note that youtube and discord will not work. The proxy is good for basic site browing or viewing static sites.

# How to implement to your site

Simply put all your content in the 'public' folder, and you should be good to go.

# Blacklist words

If you have people who use the proxy to not go on certain sites, add the URL in 'blocklist.json'
